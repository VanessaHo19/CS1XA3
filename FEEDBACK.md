# FEEDBACK

## SCRIPT INPUT FEAT (5 points)

- Should be a little more descriptive if you are running a while loop.
- A small implementation error is that I can press enter constantly and it'll just run through the program. The program should exit as soon as it encounters an error, or take the user back to the starting point.

## FEAT1 (5 points)

- Doesn't work with filenames with whitespaces

## FEAT2 (5 points)

- Doesn't work with filenames with whitespaces

## FEAT3 (5 points)

- Doesn't work with filenames with whitespaces

## CUSTOM FEAT 1 (20 points)

- Good ideas for your custom features, but I think you can challenge yourself a little bit more, as these aren't as challenging as the 10pt questions. Can be done with a modulo function, and a for loop.

## CUSTOM FEAT 2 (20 points)

## FEAT 4 (10 points)

- Good

## FEAT 5 (5 points)

- Good

## FEAT 6 (5 Points )

- Good

## README

Styling is OK. You shouldn't have blocks of text, bullet points are a lot easier to get information thorugh in a concise fashion. Also, try to incorporate the use of colour and indentation in your README in order to emphasize important parts of the text.
